Welcome to Filin Students' infrastucture documentation!
========================================================


The infrastucture is object oriented. There are three data-set object ( :class:`~PointSet.PointSet`, :class:`~PointSubSet.PointSubSet` and :class:`~RasterData.RasterData` ) which have a basic set of properties, Factoy objects and Property objects. 

The Property objects relate to the data-set, and are built by a Factory object. In each Factory there can be several functions that build the same property, but with a different algorithm.
