  abstract = {In the human visual system, visual saliency perception is a rapid pre-attention processing mechanism, which can benefit myriad visual tasks, such as segmentation, localization, and detection. While most research is devoted to saliency detection on 2D images and 3D meshes, little work has been performed for efficient saliency detection on 3D point clouds. In this paper, we present a novel point clouds saliency detection method by employing principal component analysis (PCA) in a sigma-set feature space. In this method, we first construct local shape descriptors based on covariance matrices for saliency detection, considering that covariance matrices can naturally model nonlinear correlations of different low-level compact and rotational-invariant features. Secondly, we transform these covariance matrices to vector descriptors in Euclidean vector space by applying the sigma-point technique, which keeps the inner statistics of regions of 3D point clouds. Based on our informative descriptors, PCA is employed in the descriptor space for identifying saliency patterns in a point cloud. Our method shows its advantages of being structure-sensitive, capturing geometry information and computationally efficient. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves good performance without using any topological information.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for surface curvature estimation. By using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, an 8 neighbors ring is selected from point cloud for each point. Surface normal vector is estimated by neighbors coordinates. Local surfaces are classified using the point of interest and its 8 neighbors ring coordinates. In this paper surface curvature is calculated based on normal vector and neighbors ring coordinate. Surface curvature calculated using the novel method is called umbrella curvature. To evaluate how this method performs, the curvature of a sample surface was estimated by the umbrella curvature and surface variance method. The results show that the umbrella curvature performs well and is superior in terms of accuracy. However the method in computation is more expensive than variance method.},

  abstract  = {Snakes, or active contours, are used extensively in computer vision and image processing applications, particularly to locate object boundaries. Problems associated with initialization and poor convergence to boundary concavities, however, have limited their utility. This paper presents a new external force for active contours, largely solving both problems. This external force, which we call gradient vector flow (GVF), is computed as a diffusion of the gradient vectors of a gray-level or binary edge map derived from the image. It differs fundamentally from traditional snake external forces in that it cannot be written as the negative gradient of a potential function, and the corresponding snake is formulated directly from a force balance condition rather than a variational formulation. Using several two-dimensional (2-D) examples and one three-dimensional (3-D) example, we show that GVF has a large capture range and is able to move snakes into boundary concavities},
