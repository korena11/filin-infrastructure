PointSetOpen3D class
====================

This class inherits from :class:`PointSet.PointSet` and adds functionality (such as normals computation) via
:ref:`Open3D <open3d:tutorial>`.

The class computes a KD-tree with initialization. As used in :ref:`Open3D <open3d:KDTree>`, it uses `FLANN <https://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/>`_ to build KDTrees for fast retrieval of nearest neighbors.
